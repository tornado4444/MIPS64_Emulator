# MIPS_64 EMULATOR
Here is my attempt to realese MIPS64.
## WARNING: The file been to update every time.

Maybe you're now about MIPS. MIPS - is a system of instructions and microprocessor architectures developed by MIPS Computer Systemsin accordance with the concept designing RISC processors (that is, for processors with a simplified instruction set). There are several command sets: MIPS32, MIPS64, microMIPS and nanoMIPS. In addition, extended instruction sets and processor models are available, for example, MIPS-3D, which includes a set of SIMD floating-point instructions designed to solve simple 3D problems, MDMX (MaDMaX). MIPS was mips was introduced in 1985.

So and I'm tried to release the MIPS64 emulation. And,if to be honest, I'm not sure what can to do it's correct! Let's to the down, I will explain in detail how I solved MIPS64.
